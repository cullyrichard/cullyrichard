Cully Richard's Website and Portfolio

### About
Cully Richard is an Electrical Engineering Student at the University of Maine. He is graduating in May of 2022 with his bachelors. His areas of interest include Music, Sailing, Spending time in the outdoors, volunteering and more. 

### Capstone Project

My capstone experience involved building a Pulse Oximeter that performed similarly to commercially available models. This project proved to be an incredibly valuable experience. One of the major challenges we faced was constructing a small mixed signal PCB with precision analog electronics. In order to hit our accuracy target using discrete analog components, the analog design was carefully considered. My teammate and I are in the process of generating the final report, however a project overview video will be posted on this website.

### Guitar and Audio
 

### Amateur Radio

I currently hold my Amateur Radio Liscence at the Technician level, callsign W1KXV and club callsign W1YA. Upgrading my qualfications was put on hold by world events, however I plan to upgrade the liscence in the near future. my experience as a liscenced radio operator taught me valuable RF engineering principals. This experience, along with coursework relating to Feilds and Waves

### Details LLC
  In addition to my work as an electrical engineer, I co founded Details LLC to bring high resolution 3D printed parts to the modeling industry. I currently work on this project in a nights and weekends capacity. Our current work focuses heavily on the model railroad industry however future expansion into model ships and other areas is planned.
  An example of a part I designed and manufactured is this detail part specific to the Union Pacific Railroad:

   This part demonstrated the feasiblity of our method of producing parts and validated the methodolgy we used. It was a great lesson in advanced manufacturing techniques for small scale parts that require pushing the machine to its resolution limit. 
   
   
### Pico-DCC
Pico DCC is a project of Details, LLC to bring the DCC protocol into the 21st century. It involved programming the Dual Core RP2040 to create the waveforms neceesary. The project utilizes a dual core architecture to drive a pair of transisiors and create the DCC signal. A more in depth explanation is included in the project overview video here:
