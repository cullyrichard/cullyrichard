Cully Richard's Website and Portfolio

### About

I am an Electrical Engineering Student at the University of Maine, graduating in May of 2022. I have many diverse areas of interest in engineering including music electronics, battery technology, medical, radio and more. As well as many other interests outside of my degree including railroad restoration projects, sailing, photography, traveling and whatever happens to catch my attention. I consider this diversity to be one of my greatest strengths in a work environment because I bring a unique combination of experiences. I am willing to learn and most importantly I am not afraid to be wrong. 

### Capstone Project

My capstone experience involved building a Pulse Oximeter that performed similarly to commercially available models. This project proved to be an incredibly valuable experience. One of the major challenges we faced was constructing a small mixed signal PCB with precision analog electronics. In order to hit our accuracy target using discrete analog components, the analog design was carefully considered. My teammate and I are in the process of generating the final report, however a project overview video will be posted on this website when ready. 

### Guitar and Audio

I have played guitar for the last 10+ years. With this experience came the realization that I could combine one of my greatest passions with my area of expertise. I am in the early stages of development on a few guitar related projects, including 3D printed Electric guitar pickups, effects pedals and a fully fledged guitar amplifier. This is currently a side project and development in this area will be slow. I will also be posting some guitar project related videos and images here.


### Amateur Radio

I currently hold my Amateur Radio Liscence at the General level. My callsign is W1KXV and club callsign W1YA. My experience as a liscenced radio operator taught me valuable RF engineering principals. This experience, along with my related coursework has proven to be very valuable in enhancing my understanding of electrical engineering. 

### Details LLC

In addition to my work as an electrical engineer, I co founded Details LLC to bring high resolution and highly detailed 3D printed parts to the modeling industry. I currently work on this project in a nights and weekends capacity. Our current work focuses heavily on the model railroad industry however future expansion into model ships and other areas is planned.

An example of a part I designed and manufactured is this detail part specific to the Union Pacific Railroad:

This part demonstrated the feasiblity of our method of producing parts and validated the methodolgy we used. It was a great lesson in advanced manufacturing techniques for small scale parts that require pushing the machine to its resolution limit. As this is currently a product that is under development 
   
   
### Pico-DCC

Pico DCC is a project of Details, LLC to bring the DCC protocol into the 21st century. It involved programming the Dual Core RP2040 to create the waveforms neceesary. The project utilizes a dual core architecture to drive a pair of transisiors and create the DCC signal. A more in depth explanation is included in the project overview video here:
